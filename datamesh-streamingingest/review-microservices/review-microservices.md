1. Click on the **Statistics** tab at the top. Notice the generated data. Inserts are the only DML, as the function of the demo only generates new streaming transactions. The table **Disney Transactions** is the source of these statistics.

The Credential Alias is familiar from previous steps along with Source Catalog, trail file name, and Source Table. These parameters are configured when the process was added and can be edited by selecting the pencil icon.
